twitter uses a mix of 3 APIs on their website.

# v1.1 (public) (oldest)
- pinning/unpinning tweets
- translating tweets
- creating guest tokens

# graphql (secret internal api)
- most other requests

# v2 (public) (newest)
- home timeline
- notifications

When accessing the api, you must pass:
- header:`Authentication` - app token (each app with api access has a bearer token, for tracking rate limits and app permissons. I steal mine from the twitter.com client)

If you are logged in:
- cookie:`auth_token` - login token for your account
- cookie:`_twitter_sess` - idk why this exists
- header:`x-csrf-token`, cookie:`ct0` - this is just a random number (32 hex digits) generated by the client, and its value doesn't matter as long as the ct0 cookie and x-csrf-token http header match.

If you are a guest:
- header:x-guest-token - a token generated by the `1.1/guest/activate.json` endpoint

the dark_request parameter seems to be a sort of "dry run" feature: it validates the request without actually modifying any data
